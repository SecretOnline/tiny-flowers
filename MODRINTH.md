## Getting started

### Florists' Shears

To get started with this mod, you'll need to craft some Florists' Shears. These can be made by combining Shears with any dye.

### Tiny Flowers

You can make tiny variants of all Vanilla flowers by crafting the flower with Florists' Shears. This will give you 4 of the relevant flower type.

Tiny Flowers can be placed on dirt, grass, and moss to make a Tiny Garden. Tiny Flowers can be placed multiple times and you can mix and match whatever flower types you like (including Pink Petals)!

### More interactions

Tiny Flowers are still flowers! Bees will pollinate using tiny flowers, and can be bred by using tiny flowers on them.

Florists' Shears can be used on a Tiny Garden to pick a flower up. By using the shears on a corner of the garden you can select which flower will be picked. You can then place another flower in that spot.

Using `Ctrl` (or `Cmd`) + Pick Block (i.e. Middle Click) on a Tiny Garden in Creative Mode will give you a copy of that garden to place down. It will be placed down facing the same direction as you, so you can easily rotate it.
